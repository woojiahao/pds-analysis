### Analysis 
In the [this dataset](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/enrolment-primary-by-age), it is found that the enrolment is steadily declining in recent years. The first hypothesis that I have is that this is due to the declining population that Singapore is facing. 

In order to back up this claim, I have to first identify that there is indeed a declining trend in the population and this decline actually corresponds to the years in which the enrollment rate is seen to be declining. So, pulling up [this dataset](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/births-and-fertility-annual), it can be seen that the total number of live births have been steadily plummeting since 1960 to 1985, only to shoot up between 1985 to 1990 and begin declining again from 1990 onwards. 
> All the points brought up previously can be researched to further elaborate on why this is so as this could have been due to some government policy that was put into place during the period with the spike only to be met with failure, thus explaining the sudden decline again, try finding out what caused the initial drop too

However, we have to backtrack a little, I realise that there is a flaw in the initial assessment, whilst I expected the years of the child birth to perfectly correspond to the years of enrollment, I failed to take into account the fact that each child has to wait for at least 6 years to attend primary school and this is why there is some kind of delay in the decline of the child birth and the admission rate, and this decline is around 6 years too.
> Here, there should be a flaw with the initial assessment seeing how the enrollment rate won't perfectly align with the birth rate. If there is, it is because those children who are born in year xxxx, will have to wait for 6 years before they are eligible to attend primary school and this should be reflected in the 2 line graphs (perhaps show an compound line graph to show the comparison)

Now that we have established the reasons for the declining rate of enrollment is due to a declining population, we have to determine why is there a declining population in the first place. My initial hypothesis here is _that as the times changes, women are more likely to begin working and put priority for their work over starting a family so soon, or even if they do, they might not have as many children as previous generations of women so as to be able to properly focus on their work._ Thus, the 2 key indicators for that would be to see the **ratio of working to non-working women who are giving birth to children** as well as the **overall country's GDP**.

For the first indicator, I expect that the _number of working women who are giving birth should be less than lower than that of the non-working women_, as well as the fact that _compared to past generations, the number of working women should be increasing_. To validate this hypothesis, I picked [this dataset](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/live-births-by-occupation-of-mother-and-birth-order) to analyze the ratio of working to non-working women. 
> For the dataset chosen for this analysis, keep in mind that the non-working adults are classified under PERSONS NOT ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE

To validate the second hypothesis, I decided to pick another potential indicator of working women, and that could potentially be an increase in the number of children being enrolled in a child care centre since that could hint that the parents of this child is not stay-at-home ones and thus have to send their children to the daycare centre. [The dataset chosen](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/child-care-centres-capacity-and-enrolment-annual) shows that there is a clear indication that there is an increasing number of chilren being admitted to daycare centres

***

For the second indicator, I expect that the _overall country's GDP should be rising_ since with a larger pool of working individuals, the economy should be improving. For this, I picked [the following dataset](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/gross-domestic-product-at-current-market-prices-annual)
> Another potential indicator is the mean household income, if the income is increasing, then it is a sign that not only is the man of the house working, the woman might be too

#### Might decide to add on:
Whilst the hypothesis was originally proven to be true, I was not convinced that 2 indicators would be sufficient to quantify an objective analysis, thus another indicator surfaced, and that was the **cost of having children**. Whilst a prioritisation on the woman's part might have an effect on the decling population, increasing costs of having children might also impact the rate of child birth, and this is a factor that is influenced not only by the women, but also their significant others. This cost can be broken down into sub-factors and one of them could be due to an increase in the cost of hospitalization. To quantify this claim, I used [this dataset](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/average-hospital-inpatient-bill-size)
> The prices should be increasing over time

***

After finding out the cause behind the decline in enrollments as well as possible reasons behind the declining population, I had to find out if there were methods to counter this problem. First off, I had to analyze why the previously put in place methods were failing.
> Research why the initial methods were not effective and suggest an alternative or improvement to that solution or dig up a working solution by another country and apply it

### Reflections:
This analysis might not be the most complete seeing how there is a myriad of factors that play into a declining population, such as the how the culture of the country evolves overtime, a change in mindsets, economic movement, accessibility to better healthcare facilities, government policies. This analysis can only touch the surface of the iceberg.
