		In order to validate the first hypothesised potential cause of the declining population,
		<strong><em>More women are joining the workforce and putting their careers ahead of starting a
			family.</em></strong>, we will have to take a look at the trends of the women in the workforce who are
		giving birth and if our hypothesis is correct, we should be able to see that there is an increase in the
		number of working women over time or better yet, see that the <em>number of live births by unemployed
		women is higher than the number of live births by employed women</em> as that is an indicator that
		working women are opting to not have as many children.
		<br>
		<br>
		In order to prove this, we can make use of <a
			href="https://data.gov.sg/dataset/live-births-by-occupation-of-mother-and-birth-order"
			target="_blank">this data set</a> which displays the occupation of women to the number of live births
		<br>
		<br>
		The data set contains 2 main categories of working, those who are unemployed, labelled by the
		<strong>WKRS NOT CLASSIFIABLE BY OCCUPATION</strong> and <strong>PERSONS NOT ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE</strong>
		columns and those who are working, labelled by every other column.
		<br>
		<br>
		However, as you can see, since there is a larger size of data for working women to non-working women, the
		data plotted is uneven and does not portray a very meaningful visualization, however, if we were to plot
		the data by each work category using a bar chart, the pattern becomes more obvious, over the 3 years of
		data available, you can clearly see that the number of live births by women in the
		<strong>PERSONS NOT ECONOMICALLY ACTIVE</strong> category is significantly higher than that of the other
		work categories, with only <strong>TECHNICIANS & ASSOCIATE PROFS</strong> being higher than that.
		<br>
		<br>
		Now that we have confirmed that non-working women will generally have more children than working women,
		we can then explore the exact distribution of live births for women who are not economically active in
		2015. We want to see exactly which is the most common range of children that the non-working women are
		having and from the histogram, you can see that it is between 1000 and 1050 babies.
